# HI_ProfileLine
Plot a HI profile line from TNG-100 simulation

11/1/2021: Known error for snapShot 99, subhalos with higher ordinal returns KeyError: 'GFM_Metals'. Need to check the shape of GFM_Metals for 43~
           Unexpected shape for subhalo: 
           1. Probabaly too large?
           2. Symmetry problem
           7. Seems like not much HI present here 
           42. Symmetry problem
           43. Seems like not much HI present here
